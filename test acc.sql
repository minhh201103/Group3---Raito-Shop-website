           ('BENEFITS OF GOOD ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR'
           ,'Good athletic footwear is an essential piece of equipment for any athlete, regardless of the sport or activity they participate in. It provides support, protection, and stability, which can help improve performance and reduce the risk of injury. Here are some specific benefits of good athletic footwear:

Support: Good athletic shoes have a supportive structure that helps to stabilize the foot and ankle, which is especially important during high-impact activities such as running or jumping. A supportive shoe can help prevent overpronation (excessive inward rolling of the foot) and supination (excessive outward rolling of the foot), which can lead to pain and injuries such as shin splints and plantar fasciitis.

Protection: Athletic shoes also provide protection for the feet and ankles from the impact of the ground, as well as from sharp or hard objects that may be present in certain environments (e.g., rocks or debris on a trail). This can help prevent cuts, scrapes, and bruises, as well as more serious injuries such as sprains or fractures.

Stability: Good athletic footwear helps to keep the feet and ankles stable during movement, which can improve balance and coordination. This is especially important in sports that involve sudden changes in direction, such as basketball or soccer. A stable shoe can also help prevent slips and falls, which can be particularly hazardous in wet or slippery conditions.

Comfort: Comfort is an important factor in athletic footwear, as it can affect an athlete''s performance and enjoyment of the activity. Shoes that are too tight or too loose can cause blisters, foot fatigue, and discomfort, while shoes that fit properly and offer good cushioning can help prevent these issues.

Performance: In addition to providing support, protection, and stability, good athletic footwear can also improve an athlete''s performance. Shoes with specific features (e.g., spikes for track and field, cleats for soccer) can help improve traction and increase speed and agility. Shoes with proper cushioning can help reduce the impact on the joints, which can help prevent fatigue and allow for longer, more enjoyable workouts or competitions.

Durability: Good athletic shoes are also built to withstand the wear and tear of regular use. Investing in a quality pair of shoes can save money in the long run, as they will last longer and need to be replaced less frequently.

In conclusion, good athletic footwear is an important investment for any athlete. It provides support, protection, stability, comfort, and can improve performance and reduce the risk of injury. While it may be tempting to skimp on footwear, the benefits of good athletic shoes far outweigh the initial cost.

           ,'Whether you play sports or not, you are sure to have sports shoes at home. Their use ends up making it inevitable. Although manufacturers do not recommend washing sports shoes a lot in the washing machine, it is advisable to follow these tips when washing them:

Tips for washing your sports shoes step by step
Remove the laces and insoles if possible. This will prevent these parts from coming loose or getting tangled in the wash.
Try to brush away the embedded dirt. Leave only the dirt that you cannot completely remove from the shoes, making washing as easy as possible.
Put your shoes in a special bag for washing delicate items.
Select a short wash programme without spin. The less time the shoes are in the washing machine the less time they will be exposed to possible knocks or excess water, which can damage them.
Use a moderate temperature and add Sanytol Disinfectant Stain Remover. This disinfectant additive, apart from removing the most stubborn stains, will help you finish the washing process, which will never be complete without good disinfection.
Bear in mind that while we do sports our feet sweat abundantly, and this sweat serves as food for the bacteria there may be in the shoes, thus causing the frequent appearance of a bad smell in the feet and in the footwear.
Let the shoes dry completely. If possible, drying should be done outdoors in the sun.
We recommend that you wash the laces with your laundry, or if you want to do it with the sports shoes, it is best to put them in another bag.
The insoles are always better washed by hand to prevent them from losing their shape and becoming useless.
If your shoes are not washable, follow these tips:

1.Brush off the remains of dirt and clean the outside with a damp cloth.
2.Remove the insoles. Wash them by hand and let them dry in the air.
3.Once dry, spray them with Sanytol shoe disinfectant to remove the bacteria and smells
4.Also spray the inside of the shoe before replacing the insoles
If you are always unsure about washing your sports shoes in the washing machine, we recommend you follow these tips step by step to leave them perfect. Remember that before storing and arranging your shoes, they must be clean and disinfected. We will thus reduce the chance of catching micro-organisms from their direct contact with the dirt on the street floor.'
